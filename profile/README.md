# TrueSight DAO

## Why we exist
- Our purpose is to build a Better World based on Fundamental Truth
- Our mission is to fight information pollution by providing individuals with actional insights to make critical decisions
- Our vision is a universal credibility protocol 
- Our values are courage, perserverance, vigilance and temperance

## What we do
We are a DAO, where members can build to earn. They can also earn by making correct market predictions with our protocol. They can also earn when other members pay to see their predictions.

Periodically, the DAO can vote to run a 7 War of Truths. DAO members can join the war as competitors. They can also bet on competitors to earn. To find our more, read our [quick intro guide](https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueSightDAO/blob/main/assets/2022%20True%20Sight%20DAO%20-%20concept%20presentation.pdf).

## How to participate
Apart from making market predictions, other ways to start earning is by contributing insights or hunting for bounties listed on our bounty board. 

The best way to start contributing insights is by becoming part of our public discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gEfypKdCEW).
