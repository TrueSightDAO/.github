# TrueSight DAO

![Our Meta Game](https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/justice_card.png)

## Who are we and why we exist
- TrueSight DAO envisions a world where humanity is reconnected with its inherent divinity, embraces love for all beings, and lives in harmony with nature. We believe this vision will be realized by restoring social and environmental justice through open-source principles, transparency, and accountability.

- We bring our vision to life by driving positive change through profitable social ventures that promote social and environmental justice, alleviating suffering. By building and contributing to these ventures, we earn governance tokens that increase in value as our impact grows. This increasing value allows us to create a meaningful impact on the world while supporting the self-actualization of our members.

- Our core values are Mindfulness, Compassion and Equanimity.

- Our core thesis is a metagame where participants collaboratively build profitable businesses while validating these four key hypotheses: 
    - Open-source principles have the potential to extend far beyond the tech realm, fostering impactful businesses capable of disrupting unjust practices.

    - Blockchain technology empowers precise accounting and equitable distribution of economic value, rewarding contributors according to their inputs.

    - Individuals with a clear vision of their fully realized selves are more likely to take action when presented with a path towards their truest potential.


## What we do
![Our Meta Game](https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20230804-%20gary_meta_game.png?raw=true)

- We operate a meta game, where participants build and contribute to profitable business in exchange for governance tokens. 
- The businesses we discover and build aims to address social and environmental issues. 
- The profits generated from these business are then used to enhance the value of our governance tokens, 
- This virtuous cycle empowers us to create a meaningful and positive difference in the world.
