# TrueSight DAO

## Who are we
- We are a DAO guided by our core values of Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity. 
- We believe in the inherent divinity within each individual and recognize that upholding truth is crucial for championing social and environmental justice, which are fundamental pillars for safeguarding this divinity.


## Why we exist
- Our purpose is to build a Better World based on Verifiable Truth because we believe unjust business practises causes widespread human suffering.

- Our vision is a future where a thriving, sustainable blockchain ecosystem of profitable businesses actively promotes social and environmental justice. A world where humanity lives in harmony with fellow sentient beings and the natural world.

- Our core thesis is a metagame where participants collaboratively build profitable businesses while validating these four key hypotheses: 
    - we can extend the open-source ethos beyond tech
    - we can employ blockchain for fair value distribution
    - we can surpass collective contributions with profits
    - we can enable a crypto-based universal basic income for token holders
