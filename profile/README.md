# TrueSight DAO

## Who are we
![How it works: Why are we doing this?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/main/assets/20220708%20-%20Gary%20the%20real%20threat.jpg)

- We are a community of globally distributed contributors who deeply value Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity. 
- We believe information pollution (fake news) is destabilizing liberal democratic societies, causing human suffering through ignorant decisions worldwide and eroding values we hold dear.
- We have come together with the purpose of Building a Better World based on Verifiable Truth. 


## Why we exist
![How it works: Guru creates a prediction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/main/assets/20220610_github_vision.jpg)

- Our vision is the worldwide adoption of our universal credibility protocol which allows any individual to establish himself as a subject matter expert in his area of interest using blockchain. 
- Our core thesis is if you have an accurate mental model of your environment then you are more likely to make an accurate prediction about the future than the average person.
- Our purpose is to build a Better World based on Verifiable Truth because we believe making ignorant decisions is the root cause of human suffering.
- Our mission is to fight information pollution by providing individuals with actional insights to make critical decisions
- Our immediate goal is to build a [game to meritocratize truth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WfNmf9fSkPLsesgu1NQKUbAJ42gvlFU5/edit#slide=id.g106086a7c69_0_1).

## What we do
We operate the Game of Truth. Members can earn by [building](https://truesight.me/rubric) our game or by making correct market predictions in our game once it is ready.

## Types of Credibility 
There are many different categories of decision making where Truth is important. These are the categories we are looking to extend our eco-system to  support in the near future.
