We do have cacao beans from other farmers we work with but they have not yet been processed into cacao nibs yet. Currently we are working with local production facilities in the area to convert them as and when needed.  

Prices of the cacao nibs from Oscar's farm are quoted based on the cost of cacao beans we got from farmers, added the cost of processing the cacao beans into nibs, the fuel cost our community incur bringing the beans from the farm to the production facility and then to our warehouse and a markup of USD$10 per kilogram

This USD$10 markup is the cost for planting two new trees in the formerly deforested section of the Amazon rainforest for each kilogram of cacao processed both as an offset for the carbon emission generated in the process as well as to regenerate our Amazon rainforest which is the purpose behind this project. You will be notified of the exact location of your 40 trees once they have been planted in the Amazon rainforest. Planting starts on 26th Jan

These are the location of the two other farms whose cacao beans we have in stock.
